      <h1>Anubhav Bhartiya</h1>
<p>HI! नमस्ते (naa·muh·stay) | I am Anubhav Bhartiya and Here you will get to know more about me. In the Month of July Year 2001 I was born in the
  Busy City Mumbai. Mumbai is also known as the financial capital of India. I completed my Basic education in Mumbai as I stayed there for good 12 years.
  Mumbai happens to be on the Western Coast of India. From Mumbai I shifted to Indore in the Central state of the country known as Madhya Pradesh. 
  Completed my Middle School and High School from Indore. Indore was known for its people and the variety of food which was available throughout the city. 
  Indore had two Famous Food markets First being the 56 Dukaan St. (56 Shops of Food) where food was available throughout the day and second was Sarafa Choupati
  (This was a Jewellery Trading Lane in the day and Food Street in the night). So, Food was always available throughout the city and as it was a Tier-2 city,
  so the local cultural celebration was better compared to what it was in big metro cities or the megacities such as Mumbai and Delhi. 
To Fulfil my Higher Education, I shifted to a city called as Noida which came under the National Capital Region but was under the jurisdiction of 
  Uttar Pradesh (State with the highest population). I lived there for 3 Years to complete my bachelors as my college was in Noida. I did my Bachelor of 
  Sciences in Geography Honours at Amity University, Uttar Pradesh. When I first started with this course, I was pretty confused of what did I select and 
  where did I land up as the initial subjects brushed up about the Indian Geography and parts of Human Geography which were not Interesting but later as 
  Remote Sensing and GIS came in the course became more interesting and further, I started to take more interest in the same. One year down the course Covid-19 
  lockdown came into effect and all the studies went online for almost a year and a half the college was working online and we had to study all the field subjects 
  on our own by collecting GPS data through our mobile phones. Later as the college reopened, we got back to work and did learn a lot of things on the field also 
  worked with the weather data collected by the weather station present in the campus.
After Finishing my College, I did work with a lot of people present in the field of Space Imagery or with people who had a media company for geospatial technology 
  and at the same time they started their own research wing where I did research for them. This is what my 21 years of life Sums up to.</p>
