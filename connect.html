<!-- No.3 of atleast 3 (TABLEOPTION)(link 2-4) -->
<!-- Here I dropped in icons of a few pretty famous Social Media Platforms -->
<!-- SO all the Icons are buttons and are linked to a URL which will redirect to my account where people can see my Social Media Account
and can even connect to me on that platform -->
<!-- Instagram, Facebook and Linkedin are the three major Social media platforms where people can connect with me -->
<!-- I have also linked my Mobile no. witht the Telephone command which will directly launch the Dial Pad of the phone with my no
pre-typed in the dial pad. -->
<!-- SO this is how I managed to link external URls and also add my Contac as Direct dial -->
<!-- This will eventually ease out a persons task to go through my Social media profile or connect with me on that platform -->
<!-- A clickable button eases out the work and especially if it is with the image therefore it makes the button visually attractive -->
